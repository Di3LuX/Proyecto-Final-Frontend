## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The user of our application must be able to register, login/logout, access their client area and process their orders. 
<br> 
All this, visually from the browser.
<br>
The user can also do a search in our database, either for vehicles, estates or various ibjects, by their type.
<br>
In addition to being able to buy and sell articles, the user will be able to access all the information about their shopping list.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To start, we will clone the repository (https://github.com/Di3LuX/Proyecto-Final-Frontend.git) from GitHub,
with the gitbash console or in VSC.

## Installing

Once cloned, we will install all the dependencies of our project with command in console:

```
npm i
```

This will create a folder called "node_modules" which will contain everything necessary to make our application work.

## Initializing

The package.json contains a script called "start" which we will call to launch our react project.

```
npm run start
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

We can perform all the functions mentioned above: register, login/logout, search by type, buy or sell articles and access our user area.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
